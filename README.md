## Obsidian Tasks Plugin

This is a simple plugin to help me manage my Obsidian tasks list. 

I mainly use it as a digital bullet journal, so some design choices and 
and shorthand matches that philosophy more than pure markdown todos.

### Planned Features

- Migrate incomplete tasks to the next daily note.
- Use [..X] format to count pomodoros taken to complete the task.
- Generate weekly summaries of completed tasks and pomodoros.

### How to use

- Clone this repo.
- `npm i` or `yarn` to install dependencies
- `npm run dev` to start compilation in watch mode.

### Manually installing the plugin

- Copy over `main.js`, `styles.css`, `manifest.json` to your vault `VaultFolder/.obsidian/plugins/obsidian-tasks/`.
